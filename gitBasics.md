- To create a git-repository, go to the directory you want to monitor/track
	- Then initialise the directory as a git-repo by running: 
		- ```git init```
- Now, you can track the files in this repository
	- To check the tracking status of files use:
		- ```git status```
	- To add files which aren't being tracked as of then run:
		- `git add <filename>`
	- For example, if changes have been made to multiple files, then make sure to run the `git add` command for all the files you want to track.
	- After you have *added* a file to the git *tracker*, you can record it by running:
		- `git commit`
			- A new (nano)window will open up:
				- Here you, write what changes have been made to the code.
				- ^+O to write
				- <*Enter*>
				- ^+X to exit
	- To check changes made to the file from the **most recent commit**, write:
		- `git diff`
- To Push these commits to github:
	- ```git remote add origin https://github.com/adityamarodia/Test1.git
	  git branch -M main
	  git push -u origin main
	- The `git remote` command allows you to sync your local repository with some external *remote repository*. 
		- `origin` is the name of the remote repo
		- And the web address is the location of the remote repository.
	- The branch command renames the branch to main (This is only required for the first time --- I think???)
	- The last command pushes the commits to the remote repository
		- `-u` is used to tell that the commit is "up to date" and should be pushed to the "end of the branch"
		- `origin` is name of the remote repo
		- `main` is the name of the branch which you are pushing the updates to
