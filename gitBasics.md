- To create a git-repository, go to the directory you want to monitor/track
	- Then initialise the directory as a git-repo by running: 
		- ```git init```
- Now, you can track the files in this repository
	- To check the tracking status of files use:
		- ```git status```
	- To add files which aren't being tracked as of then run:
		- `git add <filename>`
	- For example, if changes have been made to multiple files, then make sure to run the `git add` command for all the files you want to track.
	- After you have *added* a file to the git *tracker*, you can record it by running:
		- `git commit`
			- A new (nano)window will open up:
				- Here you, write what changes have been made to the code.
				- ^+O to write
				- ^+X to exit
	- To check changes made to the file from the **most recent commit**, write:
		- `git diff`
